By now, you should know what `Pandas` is, the key data structures, how to read datasets, how to explore the basic information of a DataFrame, and how to select columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering rows is a core skill in data analysis and data science. You can use it to prepare  data for further analyses and to answer *some* interesting questions. Remember our theme: with simple tools (that YOU are starting to master) you can become a data analyst!\n",

Filtering rows will help us answer three questions: 1) How safe is my favorite restaurant? 2) How safe are Evanston food establishments in general? 3) Are there enough safe options around Northwestern's campus?"
